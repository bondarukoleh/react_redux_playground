# React / Redux
A few courses for react beginners.

[Application][1] where you can add news to the page. Simple playing with `bare React`, without any external libraries. *Statefull, controlled* components and that's it.

[Application][2] that gets some information from your github:octocat: profile. 
Managing state with `redux` and `redux-thunk`. 

There are some notes about [react][3] and [redux][4].
